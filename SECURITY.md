## Reporting a Vulnerability

While the vulnerabilities in dfeR are deemed unlikely. The package maintenance team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/dfeR/security/advisories/new) feature.

The package maintainers will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
